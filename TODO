global settings are saved with the preset along with channel selection
Preset -> sequencers -> global settings (not stored in pattern) + selected pattern
       -> patterns ?
64 preset
       -> 64 patterns
can select pattern from another preset ?
banks ?
For now just store patterns globally and see if this is OK or we need some kind
of "do not mess with my settings" stuff assigned to each preset.
